# Even Odd Arrays

## Description
This is an assignment for an online course about basic JavaScript techniques. The program generates 100 random values in an array with a range of 1 to 50 and splits them into two arrays based on their index numbers: one for even index numbers and the other for odd index numbers. The minimum (min), maximum (max), sum (total), and average values are analyzed for each array, and the results are compared to determine which array has greater, less, or equal values.

## How to run
Run this program by directly running the `app.js` file with your favourite Javascript runtime.
